## Semantic Markup

It is the markup that relates to the meaning of content.

| Semantic tags          | Non-Semantic tags    |
|------------------------|----------------------|
| `<header></header>`    | `<div></div>`        |
| `<main></main>`        | `<span></span>`, etc |
| `<footer></footer>`    |                      |
| `<nav></nav>`          |                      |
| `<article></article>`  |                      |
| `<aside></aside>`, etc |                      |

- semantic tags are used to give meaning to the content they contain, making it easier for both developers and browsers to understand the structure and purpose of the content.
- non-semantic tags do not provide any information about the content they contain, they are used purely for layout and styling purposes.

## Entities

- An html entity is a piece of text ("string") that begins with an ampersand(&) and ends with a semicolon(;).
- Used to display reserved characters (which would otherwise be interpreted as html code), and invisibile characters (like non-breaking spaces).
- Can also use in place of characters that are difficult to type with a standard keyboard.
- Browser interprets them & renders correct character.

### Example:

Love symbol `&hearts;`
